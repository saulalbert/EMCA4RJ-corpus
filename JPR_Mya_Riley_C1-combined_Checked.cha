@Transcriber:	Yuanyuan Zhang checked by Siobhan Haime
@Comment: This is a video recorded interaction between two university
	students attending school in the eastern United States. Riley
	(seated on the left) is a 20 year-old biracial black woman who uses
	she/her pronouns. Mya (seated on the right) is a 21 year-old Latinx
	non-binary person who uses they/them pronouns. The recording occurs
	in Mya's university apartment. Both speakers were co-enrolled in an
	introductory linguistics course at the time of the recording, and
	this is how they know one another (they requested to do this
	recording together as they had already been hanging out outside of
	class at this point). The prompt for this recording was to "hang out
	and chat" as they normally would with each other, with no specific
	prompt for what they should talk about or what the analysts would be
	looking at outside of how they "use language in everyday
	conversations".  The names Riley and Mya are pseudonyms provided by
	the researcher who recorded this data, Joshua Raclaw. The recording
	occurred in 2018.
@Comment: The silences in the transcript are estimated time so might not be
	accurate.
